### Event Sourcing:
- Records all events that occur in the system to reconstruct the system's state at any given moment.
- Benefits include traceability of system changes, flexibility in modifying the system's state, and mitigation of concurrency issues.

### CQRS:
- Separates commands (modifying the system's state) from queries (consulting the system's state).
- Advantages include optimized performance using different databases for commands and queries, simplified system design, and avoidance of concurrency issues.

### Architecture:
- The architecture diagram demonstrates a microservices-based approach with CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns.
- It showcases how different components interact, emphasizing the separation of concerns between commands and queries.

### Project Structure (pom.xml):
- The project is a Maven project with Spring Boot version 2.6.2.
- Dependencies include Spring Boot starters for data JPA and web, MySQL connector, H2 database (runtime), Axon framework for CQRS, and Log4j for logging.

### Recommendations:
- Ensure that the MySQL database is properly configured with connection details in your application properties or YAML file.
- Check Axon framework documentation for configuration details specific to your use case.
- Keep an eye on the version compatibility of your dependencies.
